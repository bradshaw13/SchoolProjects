Class Projects while studying at Rose-Hulman


The project currently in this repository is the old 80's arcade game Dig Dug.
I worked on this project in a group of 3 throughout April 2018 in the class 
called Object Oriented Programming. 

# How to play
Collect as many points as you can by pumping up the monsters and digging up the
dirt. Hold down space bar to pump up monsters and use the arrow keys to move. 
Once all the monsters have been eliminated you will move up a level. If you 
are touched by monster or by a monsters fire then you will lose one of the 
three lives that you start with.
